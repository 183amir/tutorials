In this tutorial, you will learn how to augment your network using
a visual attention mechanism called spatial transformer
networks. You can read more about the spatial transformer
networks in the `DeepMind paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025>`__

Spatial transformer networks are a generalization of differentiable
attention to any spatial transformation. Spatial transformer networks
(STN for short) allow a neural network to learn how to perform spatial
transformations on the input image in order to enhance the geometric
invariance of the model.
For example, it can crop a region of interest, scale and correct
the orientation of an image. It can be a useful mechanism because CNNs
are not invariant to rotation and scale and more general affine
transformations.

One of the best things about STN is the ability to simply plug it into
any existing CNN with very little modification.

# Loading the data
# ----------------
#
# In this post we experiment with the classic MNIST dataset. Using a
# standard convolutional network augmented with a spatial transformer
# network.








# Training dataset

# Depicting spatial transformer networks
# --------------------------------------
#
# Spatial transformer networks boils down to three main components :
#
# -  The localization network is a regular CNN which regresses the
#    transformation parameters. The transformation is never learned
#    explicitly from this dataset, instead the network learns automatically
#    the spatial transformations that enhances the global accuracy.
# -  The grid generator generates a grid of coordinates in the input
#    image corresponding to each pixel from the output image.
# -  The sampler uses the parameters of the transformation and applies
#    it to the input image.

# .. Note::
#    We need the latest version of PyTorch that contains
#    affine_grid and grid_sample modules.

# Training the model
# ------------------
#
# Now, let's use the SGD algorithm to train the model. The network is
# learning the classification task in a supervised way. In the same time
# the model is learning STN automatically in an end-to-end fashion.



















#
# A simple test procedure to measure STN the performances on MNIST.

######################################################################
# Visualizing the STN results
# ---------------------------
#
# Now, we will inspect the results of our learned visual attention
# mechanism.
#
# We define a small helper function in order to visualize the
# transformations while training.











# We want to visualize the output of the spatial transformers layer
# after the training, we visualize a batch of input images and
# the corresponding transformed batch using STN.
